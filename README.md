# Python_Web_Scrapping
 
This project I would like to illustate my web scrapping skill with Python.

## First part of the project

For this task we will use www.example.com and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)

Task includes:

-Grabbing the title of a page

-Grabbing all elements of a class

-Getting an Image from a Website

## Second part of the project

The website: http://books.toscrape.com/index.html is specifically designed for people to scrape it. Let's try to get the title of every book that has a 2 star rating and at the end just have a Python list with all their titles.

We will do the following:

-Figure out the URL structure to go through every page

-Scrap every page in the catalogue

-Figure out what tag/class represents the Star rating

-Filter by that star rating using an if statement

-Store the results to a list
